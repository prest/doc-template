## pREST RESTFul Engine

_p_**REST** (**P**_ostgreSQL_ **REST**), simplify and accelerate development, instant, realtime, high-performance on any **Postgres** application, **existing or new**.

> It started with PostgreSQL, but we didn't _stop here_. Our purpose is to support **other databases (relational and non-relational)** - _we understand the size of the challenge, so I invite you to contribute to the evolution of the project_.

[**All releases**](/releases/)

## Mission

At _p_**REST**, we are on a mission to make the process of new business development faster by making data access _fast, secure and scalable_. We want to reach a world where access to large volumes of data is simple without complex software development!

## Problem

There is _PostgREST_ written in _Haskell_, but keeping Haskell software in production is not an easy job. With this need _p_**REST** was born.
