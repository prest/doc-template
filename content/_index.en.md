## What is pREST?

pREST is a way to serve a RESTful APIs for any database. Right now we support PostgreSQL and support to others databases such as MySQL are being developed by the community.

> It started with PostgreSQL, but we didn't _stop here_. Our purpose is to support **other databases (relational and non-relational)** - *we understand the size of the challenge, so I invite you to contribute to the evolution of the project_.

[**All releases**](/releases/)

### Because the name pREST?

**P**_ostgreSQL_ **REST**, today we trade **p** of _PostgreSQL_ to **Pure**.
**Because Pure?** Comes from **Pure functions** have lots of properties that are important in _functional programming_, including `referential transparency` (you can replace a function call with its resulting value without changing the meaning of the program).

## Problem

There is PostgREST written in Haskell, but keeping Haskell software in production is not an easy job. With this need pREST was born.
