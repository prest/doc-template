First you'll need a running instance of PostgreSQL with a database, you can go to the [PostgreSQL official documentation page on how to do that](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/tutorial-start.html).

Now that you have a database (instructions 1.1 through 1.3 Postgres' Getting Started tutorial linked above) you can follow the steps in the [Pre-existing database page](/getting-started/already-have-db/) to configurate pREST according to pREST installation method you chose earlier.
